- Commit repo for writing QuantLib natively in Rust.
- Think I'm going to write here all notes about QuantLib library first as in main structure, folders, etc. Forked Quantlib library so can see from there.
- Later I'm going to commit also the rust code already written in my other repo quantlib-multilang.
