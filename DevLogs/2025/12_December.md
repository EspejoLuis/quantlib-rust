# December

## ☀️ 1 December 2025 - Monday

- Trying [Exercism](https://exercism.org/dashboard) for practicing both in Rust and C++. Could be good.

## Pricing Engines

Notes:

- Important points (from old version of the book, maybe now they are fixed):
  - How legs with different currencies are handled ?
  - Is there clear separation:
    - Data specifying the contract (info needed to define the cash flows)
    - Market data (discount cuve)
