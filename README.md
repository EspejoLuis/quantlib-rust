# QuatLib in Rust

Documenting the process of rebuilding QuantLib in native Rust 🦀.

To do that, I’m also learning C++ to better understand the original library’s design and implementation. I'm using [Implementing Quantlib](https://www.implementingquantlib.com/p/the-book.html) by Luigi Bellabio and [A Tour of C++](https://amzn.eu/d/3ArAD7N) by Bjarne Stroustrup.
